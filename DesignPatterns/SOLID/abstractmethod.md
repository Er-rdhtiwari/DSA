### **What is `@abstractmethod`?**

The `@abstractmethod` decorator in Python is part of the `abc` module (Abstract Base Classes). It is used to define **abstract methods** in a class, which:
- **Must be implemented** by any subclass inheriting the abstract class.
- Are declared but **not implemented** in the abstract base class.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes. By using `@abstractmethod`, we enforce that all derived classes provide specific functionality.

---

### **How `@abstractmethod` Works**

1. **Define a Common Interface**:
   - The abstract method acts as a contract that all subclasses must fulfill.

2. **Prevents Instantiation of Abstract Classes**:
   - You cannot create objects of a class that contains `@abstractmethod`.

3. **Forces Implementation in Subclasses**:
   - If a subclass does not implement all `@abstractmethod` methods, it cannot be instantiated.

### **Example of `@abstractmethod`**

#### **Abstract Class Example**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        """This method must be implemented by all subclasses."""
        pass

# Subclass implementing the abstract method
class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Bark"

# Subclass implementing the abstract method
class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow"

# Abstract class cannot be instantiated
animal = Animal()  # Raises TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Animal
```

### **Relation of `@abstractmethod` to SOLID Principles**

The `@abstractmethod` decorator aligns closely with several SOLID principles:

#### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
- **How it helps**:
  - By defining abstract methods, it ensures that each subclass implements only the behavior specific to its responsibility.
- **Example**:
  - In the `Animal` abstract class, `make_sound` is the single responsibility for all subclasses. Each subclass (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`) only implements the method relevant to itself.

#### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
- **How it helps**:
  - Abstract methods enable adding new functionality (new subclasses) without modifying the existing base class or interface.
- **Example**:
  - Adding a new class `Cow` with a specific implementation of `make_sound` does not require modifying the `Animal` base class.

#### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
- **How it helps**:
  - Subclasses that implement the `@abstractmethod` can substitute their parent class in any context where the parent class is expected.
- **Example**:
  - A function that works with `Animal` objects can seamlessly handle `Dog`, `Cat`, or `Cow`.

#### **4. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
- **How it helps**:
  - Encourages depending on abstractions (abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations.
- **Example**:
  - Functions or modules interacting with `Animal` rely on the abstract `make_sound` method, not the specific implementation of `Dog` or `Cat`.

### **Practical Example Related to SOLID Principles**

#### **Abstract Class and Subclasses**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        """Abstract method to process payment."""
        pass

class CreditCardPayment(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        return f"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}"

class PayPalPayment(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        return f"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}"

class BankTransferPayment(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        return f"Processing bank transfer payment of ${amount}"
```

#### **Using Dependency Inversion**
```python
def process_payment(payment_processor: PaymentProcessor, amount: float):
    print(payment_processor.process_payment(amount))

# Example usage
payment_methods = [CreditCardPayment(), PayPalPayment(), BankTransferPayment()]
for payment_method in payment_methods:
    process_payment(payment_method, 100.0)
```

**Output**:
```
Processing credit card payment of $100.0
Processing PayPal payment of $100.0
Processing bank transfer payment of $100.0
```

### **Benefits of `@abstractmethod` in Relation to SOLID**
1. **Encapsulation of Behavior**:
   - Abstract methods encapsulate common behavior in the base class while enforcing customization in subclasses.

2. **Reduces Code Coupling**:
   - Programs rely on abstractions (`ABC` and `@abstractmethod`) rather than specific implementations.

3. **Improves Extensibility**:
   - Adheres to OCP and LSP, allowing new functionalities to be added easily while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

### **Test Cases for Abstract Methods**

#### **Testing PaymentProcessor**
```python
import pytest

def test_credit_card_payment():
    payment = CreditCardPayment()
    assert payment.process_payment(100) == "Processing credit card payment of $100"

def test_paypal_payment():
    payment = PayPalPayment()
    assert payment.process_payment(100) == "Processing PayPal payment of $100"

def test_bank_transfer_payment():
    payment = BankTransferPayment()
    assert payment.process_payment(100) == "Processing bank transfer payment of $100"

def test_abstract_class_instantiation():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        PaymentProcessor()  # Abstract class cannot be instantiated
```

### **Summary**
- **What is `@abstractmethod`?**:
  - A decorator to define methods in an abstract class that subclasses **must implement**.
- **Why is it useful?**:
  - Enforces a contract or blueprint for subclasses.
  - Ensures consistency across different implementations.
- **Relation to SOLID**:
  - Strongly aligns with OCP, LSP, and DIP by promoting abstraction, extensibility, and substitutability.
- **Practical Use**:
  - Common in scenarios like payment gateways, file handlers, database adapters, etc., where multiple implementations share the same interface.

This makes `@abstractmethod` a critical tool in designing modular, maintainable, and extensible systems.
