### **Complete 7-Day Plan**

---

### **Day 1: AWS Architecture and MySQL Basics**

#### **1. AWS Architecture**
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Understand AWS services like EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, API Gateway, and Redis.
  - Learn AWS cost management tools: Billing Dashboard, Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets.
- **Practical Scenario**:
  - Design a scalable architecture for a billing system:
    - Trigger invoice generation with S3 events.
    - Process and store invoice data in RDS.
    - Cache recent invoices in Redis.

#### **2. MySQL Basics**
- **Core Concepts**:
  - CRUD operations, Joins, Transactions (ACID), and Indexing.
  - Schema Design: Normalize tables for customers and invoices.
- **Practical Scenario**:
  - Write SQL queries to fetch overdue invoices and calculate total revenue.
  - Design normalized tables for the billing system.

### **Day 2: MongoDB, Redis, and Flask Fundamentals**

#### **1. MongoDB**
- **Core Concepts**:
  - CRUD operations, Schema Design (embedded vs. referenced documents), Aggregation Framework.
- **Practical Scenario**:
  - Design a schema for billing data in MongoDB.
  - Write an aggregation pipeline to calculate total revenue by customer.

#### **2. Redis**
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Data structures: Strings, Hashes, Lists.
  - Caching patterns: Cache Aside, Write Through, Read Through.
- **Practical Scenario**:
  - Implement caching for billing APIs using Redis.

#### **3. Flask Fundamentals**
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Routing, Request and Response objects, Error handling.
  - Basic REST API with CRUD operations.
- **Practical Scenario**:
  - Build a Flask API for customer and invoice management.

---

### **Day 3: DSA + Day 1 Practical Scenarios**

#### **1. Day 1 Practical Scenario**
- Practice the AWS Architecture scenario:
  - Set up S3 to trigger Lambda for invoice generation.
  - Store invoice data in RDS and cache frequently accessed data in Redis.

#### **2. DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)**
- **Core Algorithms**:
  - Binary Search, Two-Pointer, Sliding Window, Hashing.
- **Practical Problems**:
  - Find overdue invoices using Binary Search.
  - Optimize API usage tracking using Sliding Window.
- **Real-World Focus**:
  - Relate algorithms to scenarios like fetching customer data or calculating billing metrics.

---

### **Day 4: Flask Advanced Topics + Mock Practice**

#### **1. Flask Advanced Topics**
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, Relationships, and Transactions.
  - Flask-JWT for token-based authentication.
  - Error handling for secure and robust APIs.
- **Practical Scenario**:
  - Secure the billing API with JWT.
  - Integrate the API with RDS using Flask-SQLAlchemy.

#### **2. Mock Practice**
- Solve 1-2 coding problems within 15-20 minutes.
- Simulate scenario-based questions:
  - Design a scalable billing system.
  - Debug incorrect invoices in a live system.

---

### **Day 5: Deploy Customer and Usage Tracking Services**

#### **Goal**:
Deploy the first two microservices on AWS.

#### **Tasks**:
1. **Customer Service**:
   - Manage customer records using MongoDB.
   - Deploy Flask API to AWS (EC2 or Fargate).
   - Test CRUD operations via API Gateway.

2. **Usage Tracking Service**:
   - Accept and store usage data in S3 and MongoDB.
   - Deploy the API and configure S3 bucket triggers.
   - Test end-to-end data flow.

---

### **Day 6: Deploy Invoice and Cache Services**

#### **Goal**:
Deploy the Invoice Service and integrate it with the Cache Service.

#### **Tasks**:
1. **Invoice Service**:
   - Generate invoices from usage data.
   - Store invoice data in RDS.
   - Deploy the service to AWS.

2. **Cache Service**:
   - Use Redis for caching invoice data.
   - Deploy the service and test caching logic.
   - Test end-to-end:
     - Upload usage data â†’ Generate invoices â†’ Fetch invoices from cache or database.

---

### **Day 7: Final Deployment and Testing**

#### **Goal**:
Deploy the entire system, integrate services, and perform testing.

#### **Tasks**:
1. **Deploy Full System**:
   - Use **Terraform** or manual setup to deploy all services and infrastructure.
   - Configure API Gateway to route requests to appropriate services.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Use Postman or Swagger to test APIs.
   - Write and execute integration tests for end-to-end workflows:
     - Customer creation â†’ Usage data upload â†’ Invoice generation â†’ Invoice retrieval.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Ensure Lambda triggers are efficient.
   - Test caching and database queries for performance.

---

### **Key Considerations**
- **Day 1-4**:
  - Build foundational knowledge and practice with practical scenarios.
- **Day 5-7**:
  - Focus on microservice deployment and integration using AWS.
- **Time Management**:
  - Dedicate 3-4 hours daily to ensure progress.
