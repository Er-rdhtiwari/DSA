### **Day 1: AWS Architecture + MySQL Basics**
#### **1. AWS Architecture (2 hours)**
   - **Core Concepts**: Learn about EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, and IAM.
     - Resources: AWS documentation or videos on these services.
   - **Billing Tools**: Explore AWS Billing Dashboard, Cost Explorer, and AWS Budgets.
   - **Practice**:
     - Design a cost-effective architecture for a workload using AWS services.
     - Example: A scalable billing system using Lambda, S3, and RDS.

#### **2. MySQL Fundamentals (2 hours)**
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - CRUD operations, Joins, Transactions (ACID).
     - Indexing: Learn how and when to use indexes.
   - **Practice**:
     - Write queries to:
       - Fetch overdue billing data.
       - Optimize a query using indexing.
   - Example Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_due 
     FROM invoices 
     WHERE due_date < CURDATE() 
     GROUP BY customer_id;
     ```

#### **3. Design Patterns (1 hour)**
   - Revise **Singleton**, **Factory**, and **Strategy** patterns.
   - Implement small Python examples to solidify understanding.

### **Day 2: MongoDB + Redis + Flask Fundamentals**
#### **1. MongoDB Basics (2 hours)**
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - CRUD operations, Schema Design, Aggregation Framework.
   - **Practice**:
     - Design a schema for a billing system.
     - Write an aggregation pipeline:
       - Total revenue generated by a customer.
     - Example:
       ```python
       db.invoices.aggregate([
           {"$match": {"customer_id": 123}},
           {"$group": {"_id": "$customer_id", "total": {"$sum": "$amount"}}}
       ])
       ```

#### **2. Redis Basics (1.5 hours)**
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - Key data structures (Strings, Hashes, Lists).
     - Commands like `SET`, `GET`, `EXPIRE`.
   - **Practice**:
     - Implement a caching system for an API using Redis.
     - Example:
       ```python
       import redis
       cache = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
       cache.set('invoice:123', 'paid', ex=3600)  # Key expires in 1 hour
       ```

#### **3. Flask Fundamentals (1.5 hours)**
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - Request-Response Cycle, Routing, CRUD operations.
     - Implement a basic API with `GET` and `POST` methods.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request
     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/invoice', methods=['POST'])
     def create_invoice():
         data = request.json
         return {"message": "Invoice created", "data": data}

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```

### **Day 3: DSA + Flask Advanced Topics**
#### **1. DSA Practice (2 hours)**
   - **Algorithms**:
     - Binary Search, Two-Pointer, and Sliding Window techniques.
   - **Practice Questions**:
     - Binary Search: Find the position of an element in a sorted array.
     - Sliding Window: Maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
         max_sum, window_sum = 0, 0
         for i in range(len(arr)):
             window_sum += arr[i]
             if i >= k - 1:
                 max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
                 window_sum -= arr[i - (k - 1)]
         return max_sum
     ```

#### **2. Flask Advanced Topics (2 hours)**
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - Flask-SQLAlchemy: Models, Transactions.
     - Flask-JWT: Implement token-based authentication.
   - **Practice**:
     - Build a simple API with JWT-protected routes.
     - Integrate Flask-SQLAlchemy to fetch billing records.

#### **3. Design Patterns (1 hour)**
   - Revise **Adapter**, **Decorator**, and **Observer** patterns.
   - Implement small Python examples.

---

### **Day 4: Mock Practice and Review**
#### **1. Mock Practice (3 hours)**
   - Combine AWS, Flask, and databases into a small project:
     - Build a Flask API for a billing system:
       - Fetch billing data from MySQL.
       - Use Redis for caching.
       - Secure the API using JWT.
   - Example Workflow:
     - Create a `GET` endpoint that retrieves customer invoices.
     - Cache the result in Redis for 10 minutes.
     - Use SQLAlchemy to fetch data from MySQL.

#### **2. Review Design Patterns (1 hour)**
   - Revisit SOLID principles and patterns discussed earlier.
   - Focus on how to explain these during the interview.

#### **3. Interview Prep (1 hour)**
   - Practice explaining solutions and trade-offs.
   - Focus on structuring responses (problem, approach, challenges, solution).
   - Review notes on AWS tools, billing workflows, and scaling techniques.

### **Key Tips**
1. Prioritize hands-on practice for technical topics.
2. Relate examples to your prior experience in API development and billing systems.
3. Focus on concise, clear explanations of your solutions.
