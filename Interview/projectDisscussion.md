**Aadhar Multi-Integration Project Overview:**  
When I joined my current organization, the Aadhar multi-integration project was non-functional. As a result, the company had to rely on third-party APIs for Aadhar verification, leading to significant performance dependencies and increased costs. Since this API was one of the most frequently used by our clients, I was given the challenge of developing an in-house solution.

**Challenges Identified:**  
After discussions with my team and analyzing the situation, I identified the following key challenges:  
1. **Dependency on UIDAI:** The Aadhar verification API depended on the UIDAI website, which experienced slow response times and downtime, especially during peak hours (9 AM to 6 PM).  
2. **High Traffic Volume:** During peak periods, we received around 10,000 requests per hour, increasing to 4–5 times during end-of-month or fiscal periods. In contrast, nighttime traffic was as low as 1,000 requests per hour.  
3. **Captcha Challenges:** We lacked an in-house solution to solve captchas required by the UIDAI website.  
4. **Session Management:** The verification process required maintaining a live session for 10–15 minutes per request to handle OTP submission and validation, leading to high memory usage.  
5. **Server Overload:** During peak hours, UIDAI outages caused API requests to pile up. Some clients sent multiple requests, leading to server crashes with 5–6 lakh API calls per hour.  
6. **Previous Solution Issues:** A Kafka-based solution implemented earlier was overly complex and ineffective in managing the load.

**My Solutions:**  

1. **Replacing Kafka with Multi-Threading:**  
   - I simplified the architecture by replacing Kafka with multi-threading, better suited for IO-bound loads.  
   - A temporary third-party API was used to handle captcha issues.  
   - Load testing showed good results under low traffic, but during peak hours, response times increased significantly due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), causing client timeout errors.  

2. **Transitioning to Multi-Processing:**  
   - To address GIL limitations, I implemented a multi-processing pool, which initially worked well in production. However, over time, RAM usage escalated, leading to server crashes.  
   - As a temporary fix, I added a nightly cron job to restart the service and free up memory.

3. **Session Management Optimization:**  
   - I resolved the session persistence issue by using a Python library to save session data to files. This allowed the service to maintain session continuity without keeping live connections.  
   - This approach significantly reduced memory usage and enabled efficient session handling. Once verification was completed, session files were deleted, making the API lightweight.

4. **In-House Captcha Solution:**  
   - To build an in-house captcha solution, I created a pipeline to log captcha images and their responses from the third-party API.  
   - Correct responses were stored in a labeled dataset, while failed attempts were saved for manual correction.  
   - Within days, we amassed a labeled dataset of 50,000 correct and 15,000 incorrect captcha images. Using this, I trained a Keras model, achieving high accuracy. Failed predictions were retried, improving reliability.

5. **Handling UIDAI Downtime with Caching:**  
   - To manage heavy traffic during UIDAI outages, I implemented caching using Redis.  
   - Rules were set to avoid repeated hits for the same candidate or OTP within a specified time. This drastically reduced redundant API calls and server load.

**Outcome:**  
The in-house API now performs reliably under high traffic, reducing dependency on third-party solutions and cutting costs. Additionally, the captcha and session handling solutions enhanced efficiency, while caching mitigated downtime issues.

**Future Scope:**  
One pending challenge is further improving resilience against extended UIDAI outages. If required, I can discuss this in detail.
