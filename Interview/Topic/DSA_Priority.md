If they ask data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions, the focus will likely be on **easy-to-medium level problems** that test problem-solving skills. Since you only have 15-20 minutes to solve a question in the interview, prioritize common algorithms that are efficient and easy to implement.

Here’s a **shortlist of algorithms and related coding problems** to prepare:

---

### 1. **Binary Search**
   **Why:** It’s commonly used for searching and can be implemented quickly.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Find the position of an element in a sorted array.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `target = 7`, Output: `3`
   2. **Find the square root of a number (integer part only).**
      - Example: Input: `x = 8`, Output: `2` (since `√8` is between 2 and 3).
   3. **Search in a rotated sorted array.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `target = 0`, Output: `4`

---

### 2. **Two-Pointer Technique**
   **Why:** Useful for problems involving arrays or strings.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Check if a string is a palindrome.**
      - Example: Input: `s = "racecar"`, Output: `True`
   2. **Find a pair with a given sum in a sorted array.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, `target = 6`, Output: `[1, 3]` (0-based index).
   3. **Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, Output: `[1, 2, 3]` (remaining part in the same array).

---

### 3. **Sliding Window**
   **Why:** Solves problems involving subarrays or substrings.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [2, 3, 4, 1, 5]`, `k = 3`, Output: `10` (sum of `[4, 1, 5]`).
   2. **Find the smallest subarray with a sum ≥ `target`.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]`, `target = 7`, Output: `2` (subarray `[4, 3]`).
   3. **Longest substring without repeating characters.**
      - Example: Input: `s = "abcabcbb"`, Output: `3` (substring `abc`).

---

### 4. **Hashing**
   **Why:** Provides constant-time operations for common tasks.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Find the first non-repeating character in a string.**
      - Example: Input: `s = "aabcc"`, Output: `b`
   2. **Check if two strings are anagrams.**
      - Example: Input: `s1 = "listen"`, `s2 = "silent"`, Output: `True`
   3. **Find the intersection of two arrays.**
      - Example: Input: `arr1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]`, `arr2 = [2, 2]`, Output: `[2]`

---

### 5. **Basic Graphs (Optional)**
   **Why:** Focus only on BFS/DFS for simple traversal problems.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Find if a path exists in a graph (using BFS).**
      - Example: Input: `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 3]]`, `start = 0, end = 3`, Output: `True`
   2. **Flood fill (connected components).**
      - Example: Input: `image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]`, `sr=1, sc=1, color=2`, Output: Modified image.

### Tips for Practice and Interview:
1. **Practice Implementations:**
   - Use Python (your expertise) for all problems.
   - Focus on writing clean and readable code with comments.

2. **Optimize for Time:**
   - Write down the algorithm in plain words before coding.
   - Start coding quickly once you have clarity.

3. **Tools to Practice:**
   - Use platforms like **LeetCode (Easy)**, **HackerRank**, or **GeeksforGeeks**.

4. **Approach for Interview Questions:**
   - Understand the problem (ask clarifying questions if needed).
   - State the algorithm you’ll use and why.
   - Code step by step, explaining as you go.
   - Test your code with edge cases.
