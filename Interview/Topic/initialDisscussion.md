To prepare for the second technical round, we need to focus on scenario-based problem-solving, especially in areas relevant to your role and IBM's Cloud Billing Management project. Hereâ€™s how we can proceed:

1. **Understand Common Scenarios in Cloud Billing Systems**:
   - How to handle complex pricing models and dynamic pricing.
   - Implementing billing workflows (e.g., subscription billing, one-time payments, pay-as-you-go).
   - Managing customer data securely while ensuring compliance with regulations.
   - Dealing with performance issues in high-volume billing systems.

2. **Problem-Solving Framework**:
   Use a structured approach to tackle any scenario:
   - Understand the problem (ask clarifying questions if needed).
   - Define your approach clearly.
   - Explain how you would implement the solution (tools, technologies, steps).
   - Discuss edge cases, challenges, and how you would handle them.

3. **Prepare for Team Management Scenarios**:
   - Handling conflicts within the team or resource allocation issues.
   - Training new joiners and setting up a knowledge-sharing process.
   - Balancing development work and leadership responsibilities.

4. **Brush Up on Related Technical Skills**:
   - Development: Review concepts like API design, performance optimization, and debugging.
   - Git Standards: Practice reviewing PRs with a focus on quality, consistency, and code efficiency.
   - Cloud Skills: Be ready to design solutions using cloud-native services.

5. **Simulate Scenarios**:
   Let me create example scenarios for practice. Would you prefer technical coding scenarios, team management challenges, or project-specific case studies first?
