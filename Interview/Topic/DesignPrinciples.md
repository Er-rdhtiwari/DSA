Given your limited time, you should focus on the **most commonly used design principles and patterns** that demonstrate your expertise in building maintainable, scalable, and robust systems. Start with the SOLID principles and a few key design patterns that are practical and relevant for your experience.

---

### **1. SOLID Principles**
These principles form the foundation of good software design. Review them with practical examples:

#### **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change.
- **Example**: In a billing system, separate classes for `InvoiceGenerator` and `PaymentProcessor` ensure each handles a distinct responsibility.

#### **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Definition**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Example**: Use an abstract class `BillingStrategy` with concrete strategies for `MonthlyBilling` and `UsageBasedBilling` so you can add new strategies without modifying existing ones.

#### **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Definition**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the application.
- **Example**: Ensure a subclass of `Discount` can replace its parent class without affecting billing logic.

#### **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don’t use.
- **Example**: Instead of a monolithic `BillingService` interface, split into `InvoiceService`, `PaymentService`, and `ReportService`.

#### **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Example**: Use interfaces for database interactions (`BillingRepository`) so the implementation can be swapped (e.g., MySQL to DynamoDB).

### **2. Key Design Patterns**
Focus on patterns that are directly relevant to your API development, cloud systems, and team leadership roles:

#### **Creational Patterns**
1. **Singleton**
   - **When to Use**: Managing shared resources, like a configuration service in a cloud billing system.
   - **Example**: A `BillingConfig` class that ensures only one instance of configuration is loaded globally.

2. **Factory Method**
   - **When to Use**: When creating objects that depend on runtime conditions.
   - **Example**: Use a `BillingFactory` to generate billing objects (`SubscriptionBilling`, `UsageBilling`) based on the customer type.

---

#### **Structural Patterns**
1. **Adapter**
   - **When to Use**: To bridge incompatible interfaces.
   - **Example**: An adapter class to integrate third-party payment gateways with your billing API.

2. **Decorator**
   - **When to Use**: Add or modify functionality dynamically without altering the original object.
   - **Example**: Add discounts to an invoice dynamically without changing the core invoice class.

---

#### **Behavioral Patterns**
1. **Strategy**
   - **When to Use**: To select an algorithm at runtime.
   - **Example**: Use different billing strategies (e.g., `FlatRateBilling` vs. `UsageBasedBilling`) depending on the customer’s subscription plan.

2. **Observer**
   - **When to Use**: When one action should trigger updates in dependent components.
   - **Example**: Notify a reporting module whenever a payment is processed.

3. **Command**
   - **When to Use**: Encapsulate requests as objects to allow undoable operations.
   - **Example**: Implement undo functionality for billing corrections.

### **3. Time Allocation**
Spend your time wisely by focusing on these areas:
1. **Day 1-2**: 
   - Revise SOLID principles with real-world examples relevant to billing systems.
   - Learn 1-2 creational patterns (Singleton, Factory).
2. **Day 3**: 
   - Study 1-2 structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator).
   - Review behavioral patterns (Strategy, Observer).
3. **Day 4**:
   - Practice applying these principles and patterns in small coding examples.

---

### **How to Study Efficiently**
- **Focus on Real-World Applications**: Relate each principle or pattern to scenarios in your work.
- **Implement Mini-Examples**: For each pattern, write 10-15 lines of code to understand it.
- **Be Ready to Explain Trade-offs**: For example, why you would use Strategy over a switch-case construct.

Would you like specific examples in Python for any of these patterns?
