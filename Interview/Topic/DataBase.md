For your interview, focusing on **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Redis** is a great strategy as these are widely used databases and align with your experience. Additionally, revising key topics in **Python Flask** will demonstrate your API development expertise.

### **Database Topics to Focus On**

#### **1. MySQL (Relational Database)**
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - SQL queries: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
     - Joins: Inner, Outer, Left, and Right joins.
     - Transactions: ACID properties, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.
     - Indexing: How indexes work and their impact on query performance.
     - Normalization: Understand 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and when denormalization is beneficial.
     - Partitioning and Sharding: Basics of scaling relational databases.

   - **Real-World Practice**:
     - Write a query to retrieve billing data for customers with overdue payments.
     - Optimize a query fetching millions of records by adding proper indexes.

#### **2. MongoDB (NoSQL Database)**
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - CRUD operations: `insertOne`, `find`, `updateOne`, `deleteOne`.
     - Schema Design: Understand flexible schemas, embedded vs. referenced documents.
     - Aggregation Framework: Pipelines like `$match`, `$group`, `$lookup`.
     - Indexing in MongoDB: Compound indexes, text indexes, and their impact on queries.
     - Replication and Sharding: Basics of scalability in MongoDB.

   - **Real-World Practice**:
     - Design a schema for a billing system where each user can have multiple invoices.
     - Write an aggregation pipeline to find total revenue generated by a customer.

---

#### **3. Redis (In-Memory Database)**
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - Data Structures: Strings, Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets.
     - Use Cases: Caching, session storage, rate limiting.
     - Commands: `SET`, `GET`, `EXPIRE`, `INCR`, `HSET`, `ZRANGE`.
     - Expiry and TTL: Setting time-to-live for keys.
     - Pub/Sub and Streams: Basics of messaging with Redis.

   - **Real-World Practice**:
     - Implement caching for API responses to reduce database load.
     - Design a rate-limiting mechanism for API calls using Redis.

### **Python Flask API Framework: Topics to Revise**

#### **1. Core Flask Concepts**
   - Request-Response Cycle:
     - Understanding `request` and `response` objects.
     - Methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
   - Routing:
     - Defining and handling dynamic routes.
     - Example: `@app.route('/user/<int:id>')`.

#### **2. Flask Extensions**
   - **Flask-SQLAlchemy**:
     - ORM basics: Models, Queries, Relationships.
     - Transactions: Using `session.commit()` and `session.rollback()`.
   - **Flask-RESTful**:
     - Building RESTful APIs with resources.
     - Handling exceptions and custom error messages.
   - **Flask-JWT-Extended**:
     - Implementing authentication with JWT.
     - Securing routes and roles.

#### **3. API Development Best Practices**
   - **Input Validation**:
     - Use libraries like `marshmallow` or `Flask-WTF`.
     - Validate data formats (e.g., email, phone).
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Custom error messages and status codes (`404`, `500`, etc.).
   - **Rate Limiting**:
     - Prevent abuse using libraries like `Flask-Limiter`.

#### **4. Performance Optimization**
   - Use of caching mechanisms (Redis) for frequent data.
   - Implementing pagination for large datasets.
   - Database query optimization.

#### **5. Deployment**
   - Packaging and running Flask applications in Docker.
   - Using **Gunicorn** or **uWSGI** for production.
   - Logging and monitoring using tools like Grafana or CloudWatch.

### **How to Prioritize**
1. **Day 1**: Revise MySQL queries and indexing; practice a few schema design problems.
2. **Day 2**: Focus on MongoDB and Redis concepts and write code snippets for real-world use cases.
3. **Day 3**: Revise Flask fundamentals, API best practices, and Flask extensions.
4. **Day 4**: Mock a small project integrating Flask with MySQL/MongoDB and Redis.
