**Introduction:**  
Good morning, and thank you for this opportunity. My name is Radhe Shyam Tiwari, and I have 10 years of IT experience, with 8 years specializing in Python backend development. Currently, I work as a Lead Developer at Infobell IT, where I lead a team of six, including testers, frontend, and backend developers.  

In my role, I contribute both as an individual developer and as a team leader. On a day-to-day basis, I write Python APIs, Linux shell scripts, Ansible scripts, and Docker configurations for various projects. I am actively involved in planning and prioritizing tasks such as bug fixes, enhancements, and new feature development, while also reviewing code and ensuring timely delivery.  

I focus on two main areas:  
1. **Automation:** I work on DPDK benchmarking using Python, Shell scripting, and Ansible, automating processes like BIOS configuration and creating CLI and API-based frameworks for testing. I also optimize performance for tools like OVS, Iperf2, and Iperf3.  
2. **API Development:** I use Python Flask to build APIs and deploy them with Docker and Kubernetes. I also utilize AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, and Bedrock to create scalable solutions.  

One of my key contributions has been leading the AMD benchmark automation project, where I developed frameworks for CPU performance testing and integrated network-based tools like TestPMD and L2/L3 forwarding.  

Additionally, I regularly participate in client meetings to discuss updates and plan features, ensuring alignment between business goals and technical solutions. My experience also includes mentoring my team, ensuring they follow best practices, and contributing to high-quality deliverables.  

If it’s alright, I’d love to share details about my Aadhar multi-integration project, which highlights my technical and leadership skills.
