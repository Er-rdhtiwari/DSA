5. **Simulate Scenarios**:
   Let me create example scenarios for practice. Would you prefer technical coding scenarios, team management challenges, or project-specific case studies first?

Yes, studying AWS architecture and billing systems will definitely help you prepare for the interview, given the relevance to the IBM Cloud Billing Management project. However, since you have a limited time frame of 3-4 days with 4-5 hours daily, it’s essential to focus on high-impact areas. Here's how you can limit the scope effectively:

---

---

### Additional Tips:
- **Focus on Breadth, Not Depth:** Learn key concepts rather than mastering every detail.
- **Prepare Explanations:** Be ready to explain technical solutions clearly, including trade-offs.
- **Relate to Experience:** Wherever possible, relate AWS and billing system concepts to your prior experience and challenges.

By following this plan, you'll be well-prepared and confident for the scenario-based questions in your interview. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific topic or need tailored practice scenarios!

If they ask data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions, the focus will likely be on **easy-to-medium level problems** that test problem-solving skills. Since you only have 15-20 minutes to solve a question in the interview, prioritize common algorithms that are efficient and easy to implement.

Here’s a **shortlist of algorithms and related coding problems** to prepare:

---

### 1. **Binary Search**
   **Why:** It’s commonly used for searching and can be implemented quickly.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Find the position of an element in a sorted array.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `target = 7`, Output: `3`
   2. **Find the square root of a number (integer part only).**
      - Example: Input: `x = 8`, Output: `2` (since `√8` is between 2 and 3).
   3. **Search in a rotated sorted array.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `target = 0`, Output: `4`

---

### 2. **Two-Pointer Technique**
   **Why:** Useful for problems involving arrays or strings.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Check if a string is a palindrome.**
      - Example: Input: `s = "racecar"`, Output: `True`
   2. **Find a pair with a given sum in a sorted array.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, `target = 6`, Output: `[1, 3]` (0-based index).
   3. **Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, Output: `[1, 2, 3]` (remaining part in the same array).

---

### 3. **Sliding Window**
   **Why:** Solves problems involving subarrays or substrings.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [2, 3, 4, 1, 5]`, `k = 3`, Output: `10` (sum of `[4, 1, 5]`).
   2. **Find the smallest subarray with a sum ≥ `target`.**
      - Example: Input: `arr = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]`, `target = 7`, Output: `2` (subarray `[4, 3]`).
   3. **Longest substring without repeating characters.**
      - Example: Input: `s = "abcabcbb"`, Output: `3` (substring `abc`).

---

### 4. **Hashing**
   **Why:** Provides constant-time operations for common tasks.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Find the first non-repeating character in a string.**
      - Example: Input: `s = "aabcc"`, Output: `b`
   2. **Check if two strings are anagrams.**
      - Example: Input: `s1 = "listen"`, `s2 = "silent"`, Output: `True`
   3. **Find the intersection of two arrays.**
      - Example: Input: `arr1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]`, `arr2 = [2, 2]`, Output: `[2]`

---

### 5. **Basic Graphs (Optional)**
   **Why:** Focus only on BFS/DFS for simple traversal problems.

   **Coding Questions:**
   1. **Find if a path exists in a graph (using BFS).**
      - Example: Input: `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 3]]`, `start = 0, end = 3`, Output: `True`
   2. **Flood fill (connected components).**
      - Example: Input: `image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]`, `sr=1, sc=1, color=2`, Output: Modified image.

Given your limited time, you should focus on the **most commonly used design principles and patterns** that demonstrate your expertise in building maintainable, scalable, and robust systems. Start with the SOLID principles and a few key design patterns that are practical and relevant for your experience.

---

### **1. SOLID Principles**
These principles form the foundation of good software design. Review them with practical examples:

#### **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change.
- **Example**: In a billing system, separate classes for `InvoiceGenerator` and `PaymentProcessor` ensure each handles a distinct responsibility.

#### **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Definition**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Example**: Use an abstract class `BillingStrategy` with concrete strategies for `MonthlyBilling` and `UsageBasedBilling` so you can add new strategies without modifying existing ones.

#### **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Definition**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the application.
- **Example**: Ensure a subclass of `Discount` can replace its parent class without affecting billing logic.

#### **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don’t use.
- **Example**: Instead of a monolithic `BillingService` interface, split into `InvoiceService`, `PaymentService`, and `ReportService`.

#### **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Example**: Use interfaces for database interactions (`BillingRepository`) so the implementation can be swapped (e.g., MySQL to DynamoDB).

---

### **2. Key Design Patterns**
Focus on patterns that are directly relevant to your API development, cloud systems, and team leadership roles:

#### **Creational Patterns**
1. **Singleton**
   - **When to Use**: Managing shared resources, like a configuration service in a cloud billing system.
   - **Example**: A `BillingConfig` class that ensures only one instance of configuration is loaded globally.

2. **Factory Method**
   - **When to Use**: When creating objects that depend on runtime conditions.
   - **Example**: Use a `BillingFactory` to generate billing objects (`SubscriptionBilling`, `UsageBilling`) based on the customer type.

---

#### **Structural Patterns**
1. **Adapter**
   - **When to Use**: To bridge incompatible interfaces.
   - **Example**: An adapter class to integrate third-party payment gateways with your billing API.

2. **Decorator**
   - **When to Use**: Add or modify functionality dynamically without altering the original object.
   - **Example**: Add discounts to an invoice dynamically without changing the core invoice class.

---

#### **Behavioral Patterns**
1. **Strategy**
   - **When to Use**: To select an algorithm at runtime.
   - **Example**: Use different billing strategies (e.g., `FlatRateBilling` vs. `UsageBasedBilling`) depending on the customer’s subscription plan.

2. **Observer**
   - **When to Use**: When one action should trigger updates in dependent components.
   - **Example**: Notify a reporting module whenever a payment is processed.

3. **Command**
   - **When to Use**: Encapsulate requests as objects to allow undoable operations.
   - **Example**: Implement undo functionality for billing corrections.

---

### **3. Time Allocation**
Spend your time wisely by focusing on these areas:
1. **Day 1-2**: 
   - Revise SOLID principles with real-world examples relevant to billing systems.
   - Learn 1-2 creational patterns (Singleton, Factory).
2. **Day 3**: 
   - Study 1-2 structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator).
   - Review behavioral patterns (Strategy, Observer).
3. **Day 4**:
   - Practice applying these principles and patterns in small coding examples.

---

### **How to Study Efficiently**
- **Focus on Real-World Applications**: Relate each principle or pattern to scenarios in your work.
- **Implement Mini-Examples**: For each pattern, write 10-15 lines of code to understand it.
- **Be Ready to Explain Trade-offs**: For example, why you would use Strategy over a switch-case construct.

Would you like specific examples in Python for any of these patterns?

For your interview, focusing on **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Redis** is a great strategy as these are widely used databases and align with your experience. Additionally, revising key topics in **Python Flask** will demonstrate your API development expertise.
