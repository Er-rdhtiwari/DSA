To speak this introduction effectively in an interview, follow these steps:

### **Preparation Tips:**
1. **Understand the Flow:** Break your introduction into smaller sections:
   - Personal and professional background.
   - Current role and daily responsibilities.
   - Key projects and technical contributions.
   - Wrap-up with an invitation to discuss a specific project.
   
2. **Practice Out Loud:** Read the introduction several times to ensure you’re comfortable with the flow. Pay attention to pauses and emphasize key points.

3. **Simplify as You Speak:** Focus on speaking naturally. If you forget a word, rephrase rather than trying to recall the exact wording.

4. **Be Confident:** Speak clearly and maintain a steady pace. Smiling can help convey enthusiasm.
