To solve the coding exercise shown in the image, where the goal is to find the shortest path between two rooms in a text-based adventure game, we can approach this problem as a shortest-path problem in an undirected graph. The rooms are the nodes, and the connections between the rooms are the edges.

I'll provide three different Python implementations to solve this problem, along with an explanation of the thought process behind each solution.

### Problem Breakdown:
- Each room is represented as a node.
- Connections between rooms are represented as bidirectional edges in the form of strings like `"RoomA-RoomB"`.
- The task is to find the shortest path between two rooms using these connections.

## Solution 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Approach:
- The BFS algorithm is commonly used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph. It explores nodes layer by layer, making it ideal for this task.
- We'll create an adjacency list from the given room connections.
- Using BFS, we'll explore all possible paths from the starting room to the target room.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def findShortestPath(start, end, rooms):
    # Build the adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for connection in rooms:
        room1, room2 = connection.split('-')
        graph[room1].append(room2)
        graph[room2].append(room1)

    # BFS to find the shortest path
    queue = deque([[start]])
    visited = set([start])

    while queue:
        path = queue.popleft()
        current_room = path[-1]

        # If we reach the end, return the path
        if current_room == end:
            return path

        # Explore neighboring rooms
        for neighbor in graph[current_room]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(path + [neighbor])

    return []  # If no path is found
```

### Explanation:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.
- The adjacency list is built using a dictionary where each room points to a list of connected rooms.
- We use a queue to store paths as we explore the graph layer by layer. When we reach the target room, we return the path.
- The complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of rooms and E is the number of connections.

## Solution 2: Depth-First Search (DFS) with Backtracking

### Approach:
- DFS can also be used to find paths in a graph. However, DFS explores one path as deep as possible before backtracking.
- In this solution, we use DFS but also keep track of the shortest path during the exploration.
  
```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict
def findShortestPathDFS(start, end, rooms):
    # Build the adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for connection in rooms:
        room1, room2 = connection.split('-')
        graph[room1].append(room2)
        graph[room2].append(room1)

    def dfs(current_room, target_room, visited, path):
        if current_room == target_room:
            return path
        
        shortest = None
        for neighbor in graph[current_room]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                candidate_path = dfs(neighbor, target_room, visited, path + [neighbor])
                visited.remove(neighbor)  # Backtrack
                if candidate_path and (shortest is None or len(candidate_path) < len(shortest)):
                    shortest = candidate_path
        
        return shortest

    return dfs(start, end, set([start]), [start]) or []
```

### Explanation:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** explores as deep as possible and uses backtracking to find other possible paths.
- We recursively explore each neighbor, keeping track of the path length and updating the shortest path when necessary.
- This solution is less efficient than BFS because it explores every path, making it O(V!) in the worst case, where V is the number of rooms.

## Solution 3: Dijkstra's Algorithm (Overkill for Unweighted Graphs)

### Approach:
- Even though the problem is unweighted, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used as a demonstration. It's normally used for weighted graphs, but in this case, all edges have the same weight (1), so it behaves similarly to BFS.
- We use a priority queue to explore nodes with the shortest path first.

```python
import heapq
from collections import deque, defaultdict
def findShortestPathDijkstra(start, end, rooms):
    # Build the adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for connection in rooms:
        room1, room2 = connection.split('-')
        graph[room1].append(room2)
        graph[room2].append(room1)

    # Priority queue for Dijkstra's algorithm
    pq = [(0, start, [start])]  # (distance, room, path)
    visited = set()

    while pq:
        distance, current_room, path = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_room in visited:
            continue

        visited.add(current_room)

        # If we reach the end, return the path
        if current_room == end:
            return path

        # Explore neighboring rooms
        for neighbor in graph[current_room]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance + 1, neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

    return []
```

### Explanation:
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** is used to find the shortest path in weighted graphs, but it works here by assigning the same weight (1) to all edges.
- We maintain a priority queue to always explore the closest node first (since all edge weights are the same, it behaves like BFS).
- This is an overkill solution for this problem but can be useful if the graph were weighted.

---

### Additional Information:
- **Choosing BFS**: In this problem, BFS is the optimal solution as the graph is unweighted, and we are simply looking for the shortest path in terms of the number of rooms traversed.
- **DFS**: DFS can be useful in scenarios where we want to explore all paths (e.g., for backtracking problems or when we care about finding multiple paths).
- **Dijkstra**: This solution is more general and would be necessary if the connections between rooms had weights (e.g., different "distances" between rooms), but it's overkill here.

Let me know if you want further elaboration on any of these!
